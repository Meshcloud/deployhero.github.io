# The Sample Application

Our sample application is based on [pong_matcher_go](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/pong_matcher_go), a small REST API that can match ping-pong players. It's implemented in [Go](https://golang.org/) and uses a MySQL database as its backend. If you haven't worked with either of these technologies before, that's not a big deal. This tutorial looks at how we can automate delivery of this application and we will only very lightly touch the code.
